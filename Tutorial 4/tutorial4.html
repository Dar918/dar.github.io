A 
<font size=6><strong><i>shepherd</i></strong></font> boy 
in a village used to take his herd
of sheed across the fields near the forest.
He felt his job was very dull and wanted
to have some fun.
</p>

<br>

<p align=justify>
One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted,
"Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!"
Farmers working in the nearby fields came running 
for help, but didn't find any wolf.
</p>

<br>

<p align=justify>
The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There 
is no wolf here".
<font size=6><strong><i>The boy played similar tricks
repeatedly for many days.</i></strong></font>
</p>

<br>

<p align=justify>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in
the field with the herd of sheep. Suddenly, a wolf came
out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the 
lambs. The boy was frightened and cried loudly, 
"Wolf! Wolf! <strike>The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"</strike>
</p>

<br>

<p align=justify>
<font size=5 color=purple>The farmers</font> 
<font color=purple><sup>thought</sup></font>
<font size=5 color=purple>the boy was playing </font>
<font color=purple><sub>mischief</sub></font>
<font size=5 color=purple> again. </font>
So, no one paid attention to him
and didn't come to his help.
